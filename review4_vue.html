						en_article: "US President Donald Trump called a surprise press conference in the White House briefing room as the stock market surpassed 30,000 points for the first time on November 24. Trump’s appearance came as he has increasingly been out of the public eye since his election defeat to Joe Biden. President Trump spoke in the briefing room as Vice President Mike Pence stood behind him, expressionless. “I just want to congratulate everybody. The stock market Dow Jones Industrial Average just hit 30,000, which is the highest in history. We have never broken 30,000 and that is despite everything that has taken place with the pandemic,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “Never been broken, that number. That’s a sacred number, 30,000,” he added. “That’s the ninth time since the beginning of 2020, and it’s the 48th time that we’ve broken records during the Trump administration,” said the outgoing president. Trump has bragged about a stunning run-up in the stock market as evidence of his success in the White House, taking credit for soaring highs and brushing off periodic dips. His brief appearance may have been an attempt to get credit for the historic rise on the Dow and to steal the spotlight from Biden. His remarks on the stock market were delivered roughly an hour after the Dow crossed the 30,000 milestone. Vaccine optimism drove a broad rally in stocks. The rally was also supported by the likelihood that former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will be Biden’s pick as the next Treasury Secretary. At a hurriedly convened media gathering in the White House press briefing room, Trump spoke for 65 seconds and then vanished without taking any questions from reporters. ",
